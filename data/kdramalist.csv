In 1919, during the Japanese colonial period, two events paved the way for the independence of Korea, the March 1st Movement and the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea. And with it, a covert armament for freedom was born, the Heroic Corps. Historically and in the drama, the man leading the corps goes by the name of Kim Won Bong, his real name only a few people know. He rarely stays in one area for more than two hours and sleeps for only short periods at a time. With fiery passion in his heart, he moves about swiftly and dreams for his country's independence. Lee Young Jin a Korean woman raised by a Japanese military doctor follows in her surrogate father's footsteps, and through a series of events, attends a prestigious medical university in Shanghai. She returns to Joseon and becomes the first female surgeon. The two them cross paths, and although they follow different ideologies, Won Bong soon realizes his need for her and begins to regret sending her deep into enemy territory. These two characters will walk together, sometimes run, sometimes fall, only to get back up again to chase their dreams. Bearing with them the pain and suffering of the historical events that shaped Korea's independence, they hope to instill the past so that it will never be forgotten.—Viki"

Yoo Jung is a girl who dreams to be the top porcelain artist of the Joseon Dynasty. She is gifted with innate talent and skill in porcelain-making. She develops her dream, builds up her skill, and endeavors to become the best porcelain artist. The drama is set in the 'Boon Won' porcelain workshop in Joseon Dynasty. The porcelain produced in Joseon Dynasty is evaluated to have the highest quality of the 16th century in Asia. The porcelain culture is known to be the mixture of science and art. This drama tells about Jung Yi's early life in Joseon instead of Japan, where a shrine is dedicated to her. This drama also depicts the love story of Jung Yi and Prince Kwang Hae, a sad prince whose life was like a wild storm.

When a dutiful wife and loving mother realizes that she has lost a sense of who she is, the fates provide a murderously good way for her to find herself. Shim Jae Bok (Ko So Yung) is a legal assistant and mother of two. She can't stand it when things are unfair. She also hates the people who look down on her because she is a working ahjumma (older woman). Plus, she's got a temper that would make sailors blush. Still, Shim Jae Bok puts up with all the condescension and false flattery around her. That is because Shim Jae Bok's life is not about her; it's about her family, and the future of her kids depends on her bowing her head and staying respectful. This means that Shim Jae Bok even puts up with the the fact that her husband Goo Jung Hee (Yoon Sang Hyun) is having an affair with the much younger Jung Na Mi (Im Se Mi from Shopping King Louis). Plus, her boss from hell Kang Bong Goo (Sung Joon from Hyde, Jekyll and I), tells her she is out of a job. Her life is in a tailspin, and then something miraculous happens. Shim Jae Bok receives an offer for an apartment from Lee Eun Hee (Jo Yeo Jung from Divorce Lawyers in Love), an offer that is way too good to be true. Suddenly, the miracle becomes a disaster. The eccentric ahjumma finds herself in the middle of a murder mystery. All the chaos in her life comes full circle, and Shim Jae Bok realizes that someone is destroying her life, piece by piece. Now, our ahjumma has to regain her true self--the kind who fights injustice and doesn't tolerate nonsense--in order to save what she has left. But when you have spent years pretending to be perfect, is it even possible to be yourself? Also known as Perfect Wife, Ms. Perfect is directed by Hong Seuk Ku (Golden"

Ambitious, he moved into TV dramas which he helps with his star power and hinders with his terrible acting. He also has an exploitative, unethical manager. Yoon Gae Hwa is a housewife divorced from a rich husband who needs to earn enough money to keep her daughter in her custody while her ex-husband's new wife doesn't want the daughter of a previous wife around. Gae Hwa's sole prior work experience is 6 months as a reporter for a weekly scandal rag. Her first jobs shown in the series are unsuccessful but include 1 day as housekeeper for Sung Min Woo where a babysitting emergency forces her to leave early, infuriating Sung Min Woo. Shortly afterwards, she finds another job at a musical production company, learns a secret about Sung Min Woo, and convinces him to work on the agency's musical, and becomes Min Woo's handler for that agency as it prepares to put on a musical starring Min Woo (if he ever improves as an actor). Handling Min Woo is no easy task due to their mutual antagonism, spurred by Min Woo's immaturity. Min Woo grows up as he faces the challenges of caring for his unexpected 5-year-old daughter Ye Eun, the result of an affair several years earlier, and by Gae Hwa's example in caring for the otherwise unprotected Ye Eun. Min Woo gains maturity very quickly as he learns to accept and love his daughter and becomes something unexpected - a good actor. The romance also ends satisfyingly - but I'm not telling that part of the ending.—dgdg"

Deep down, though, she does wish something would happen in her love life. As fate would have it, she meets Go Sang Sik (Ji Jin Hee), an environmental facility section chief at city hall who sincerely believes he does not need any romance in his life. But when the two meet, love finds its way into their lives. Now, in a revival of the kind of romance they both left behind years ago, Kang Min Joo and Go Sang Sik will have to learn that no matter how much they try to deny it, the heart wants what the heart wants. Adding to the drama are Go Mi Ryeo (Oh My Ghostess star Kim Seul Gi), a webtoon writer and Sang Sik's little sister, and Min Ji Sun (Detectives of Seonam Girls' High School alum Stephanie Lee), a family friend's old flame who will form a love triangle with the two hesitant romantics. An official remake of the 2012 hit Japanese drama of the same name, Second to Last Love comes from director Choi Young Hoon, who has come a long way since his days as an assistant director on The Painter of the Wind. Screenwriter Choi Yoon Jung, whose daunting resume includes hits such as Mr. Baek, Emergency Couple and Lie to Me, pens the adaptation, once again channeling her nuanced understanding of what happens when you find romance where you least expect it. The first episode of Second to Last Love will air on SBS on July 30, 2016, with subsequent episodes airing every Saturday and Sunday at 10:00PM, in the time slot vacated by the conclusion of Beautiful Gong Shim. The drama is expected to run for 20 episodes, with an expected finale some time in September 2016.

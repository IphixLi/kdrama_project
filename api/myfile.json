Despite her witchy reputation at work, 39-year-old tabloid reporter Ban Ji Yeon (Uhm Jung Hwa) is ultra focused on her job. What her colleagues don't know, however, is that the source of her prowess is a broken heart: Since being stood up by her ex-fiance, Ji Yeon has completely written off romance. But in a rare moment of vulnerability, a 25-year-old jack of all trades named Yoon Dong Ha (Park Seo Joon) becomes her unlikely hero. Will they act on their intense sexual tension, or is age a dealbreaker?"

Eun-Ho and Dong-Jin meet one day at the bookstore where he works at and they're immediately drawn to each other. They fall in love after subsequent meetings, and the two are married like millions of others who are in similar situations. But two years later they are divorced, and that's where the story opens. A pair of divorc\u00e9es sitting across from each other talking about each other's lives. There's nothing about them that stands out from the crowd. They have ordinary jobs, he works at a bookstore and she at the fitness club. Neither is extremely good-looking, nor rich, nor charismatic. But there is something different about them, and as the story reveals the reasons behind their divorce, their continuing meetings after divorce, their mingling in each other's lives, their matchmaking attempt for each other, and their internal monologues about each other, it becomes apparent they are each other's destiny if such thing exists. But even so, getting back together might be asking too much, since that would open up a wound that they've tried to bury for three years. Furthermore their new love-interests, Mi-Youn and Hyeon-Joong are marking their steps into Dong-Jin and Eun-Ho's lives, and the new love might just be a wiser option for two that have tried but failed already. In fact, Hyeon-Joong may have more things in common with Eun-Ho than she ever did with Dong-Jin, and Mi-Youn seems to need Dong-Jin more than Eun-Ho ever did, this alone might be enough for the pair of divorc\u00e9es to finally cut the tie between them.\n\n\u2014Anonymous"

If i tell you the nun is So Yi Yoon, you can say so what, surely remembering ARAHAN, SHADOWLESS SWORD and so. Less usual could sounds that So Yi don't repeat neither a single kick nor a fist in the 103 chapters. Angel s Revenge instead is a tearful story, with some enjoying characters, the hated Jang Taejong, notorious villain, the grand mother Gong, the nun, Sister Maria, returning to a civil Lee Seonyu, to investigate the murder of her sister, Lee JinYU. Its a touching, sometimes painful enormous movie where almost all the stars do right, but...\u00bfcan somebody explain why So Yi begins the movie kicking fine but never ever she defends herself against the frequents attacks ?\n\n\u2014mau davi"

With only a high school education and big dreams of being a fashion designer, she has her work cut out for her. The only thing she has going for her in the cutthroat fashion world is her youthful appearance. In a fortunate accident, she gets mistaken for her younger sister Lee So Jin for a modeling job and manages to land a job at her dream fashion company. There, she meets one of the managing directors, Choi Jin Wook, who looks far older than he really is. The two of them clash, especially since Jin Wook treats So Young with disrespect, as if she is younger than he is-though she's actually his senior! See if age really does matter in this tale of love and fashion that will make you smile no matter how old you are."

The first \"sister\" is Kang Ha Ri (Kim Joo Hyun), who has a super personality that's probably a bit too bright for her profession. She is a part-timer, who works at a stationary store and nail shop.

The third \"sister\" is Kim Eun Hyang (Oh Yoon Ah), who is chic and elegant. She once worked as a secretary at a huge firm. However, now she focuses entirely on raising her daughter. Together, these three focus on helping each other through tough times and face everything life throws their way. Looking for a way to heal, they bring some joy into their life by caring for a young girl together. Joining the cast is also Seol Ki Chan (Lee Ji Hoon from Go Ho's Starry Night), a man who grew up in an orphanage and Yang Dal Hee (Kim Da Som, aka Dasom from SISTAR), a charming and intelligent girl who also seems to lie quite a bit and hates being poor.

The drama is written by Kim Sun Ok (Temptation of an Angel), who is reuniting with her Temptation of Wife star Jang Seo Hee.

Geum-ran learns that Kang-joon has been having an affair with sophisticated broadcast announcer Gyo Chae-yeon (Wang Ji-hye), and he asks for a divorce. When she sees her in-laws welcoming Chae-yeon with open arms, the distraught Geum-ran threatens her husband, who follows her and causes her to drive her car off a cliff. Everyone assumes that Geum-ran committed suicide and attends her funeral, not knowing that she's still alive. To get revenge against those who've wronged and betrayed her, Geum-ran begs Han Tae-hee (Joo Sang-wook), whom she thought was the plastic surgeon of extreme-makeover television show Change, to transform her, and he reluctantly agrees because of his own ulterior motives. After weight loss and surgery, Geum-ran emerges from the full-body makeover as a stunningly beautiful woman, and she begins calling herself the new name Sara (Han Ye-seul), albeit retaining her coarse ajumma personality. With Tae-hee as her life coach, they scheme to ruin Kang-joon and Chae-yeon's upcoming wedding in three weeks. But as Sara interacts with Kang-joon in their staged run-ins, old feelings resurface, and she decides that instead of destroying him, she wants her husband back. They adjust their plan accordingly, though Tae-hee soon finds himself falling for Sara."

He is obsessed with success, which is probably both his greatest flaw and strength, since it makes him steely and fierce. He finds a hated enemy, a rival and a teacher in Professor Kim Sang Chul (Jung Jin Young), a world famous neurologist whose friendly demeanor and kindness with his patients acts as a stark contrast to Lee Kang Hoon's cold and unforgiving attitude. Yoon Ji Hye (Choi Jung Won) is a third-year resident in the neurosurgery department who is well-liked for her warm bedside manner. She is initially a thorn in Kang Hoon's side with her criticisms of his behavior, but later becomes his staunchest supporter. Seo Joon Suk (Jo Dong Hyuk) is Kang Hoon's classmate and rival in both love and career.\n\n\u2014D-Wiki"

As if brought together by fate, Yeon Woo's life is forever changed the day he meets Yoo Han. Falling for the boy's many charms, Yeon Woo is overwhelmed by the unexpected rush of emotions he feels every time Yoo Han is near.

While Yeon Woo ponders his fate, his aunt Yi Rang searches desperately for the sister who went missing years ago. Joining his aunt on her quest, Yeon Woo recruits Yoo Han's help and together they search for his mother. As they dig deeper into the mystery surrounding her disappearance, an unexpected story begins to unfold.

In 1919, during the Japanese colonial period, two events paved the way for the independence of Korea, the March 1st Movement and the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea. And with it, a covert armament for freedom was born, the Heroic Corps. Historically and in the drama, the man leading the corps goes by the name of Kim Won Bong, his real name only a few people know. He rarely stays in one area for more than two hours and sleeps for only short periods at a time. With fiery passion in his heart, he moves about swiftly and dreams for his country's independence. Lee Young Jin a Korean woman raised by a Japanese military doctor follows in her surrogate father's footsteps, and through a series of events, attends a prestigious medical university in Shanghai. She returns to Joseon and becomes the first female surgeon. The two them cross paths, and although they follow different ideologies, Won Bong soon realizes his need for her and begins to regret sending her deep into enemy territory. These two characters will walk together, sometimes run, sometimes fall, only to get back up again to chase their dreams. Bearing with them the pain and suffering of the historical events that shaped Korea's independence, they hope to instill the past so that it will never be forgotten.\n\n\u2014Viki"

He then gets his certificate as a medical internist and applies to work at a prison, where his plan is to cozy up to all the big-shots there-business tycoons, celebrities caught for doing drugs, sports stars guilty of gambling-and to win allies, with the ultimate goal of getting revenge against the hospital that ousted him. To do so, he'll get rid of the existing prison chief doctor and claim the spot for himself.\n\n\u2014DramaBeans"

Their uncle Lee Min-yong (Kim Hye-Seong) is a 27-year-old single dad. After going through a premature marriage and early divorce, he enjoys his life back in the dating scene with his half-single and half-married status, while continuing to encounter emotionally-involved moments with his ex-wife Shin Ji at times. Smooth High Kick. is a situation comedy, which portrays the everyday lives of the main characters colliding with each other in a comical way. However, at a certain point, the surprising mysteries of their seemingly-normal surrounding characters begin to unravel one by one."

As the son of a rich business owner, Ki Tae discovers early on that he'd much rather goof off than work in one of his father's cinemas. The rascally Ki Tae \"borrows\" money from his dad and runs off to finance his future in film. From Ki Tae's early, humble days on an American military base stage, to his meteoric rise from the 1960's through present day, this drama navigates beyond the smokes and mirrors and fleshes out an inspiring, true story."

In it, love outweighs what the world thinks, ignores the pain and anguish with it, and pursues its destiny. In the drama, Ma Ri is a beautiful girl, married into wealth with a seemingly perfect life. Ironically, her husband, In Wook, who looks like a more than ideal husband, is an obsessive lunatic who is also violently abusive. When he pushes her too far, she reaches out for help from Jung Won, an honest, smart, handsome plastic surgeon. And when he agrees to help her escape from her husband's hands, they fall in love. But In Wook, who is consumed by his obsession for her, isn't going to let her get away from his grasp. Watch as these two characters struggle to stay on their arduous road to love.\n\n\u2014Viki"

When a dutiful wife and loving mother realizes that she has lost a sense of who she is, the fates provide a murderously good way for her to find herself. Shim Jae Bok (Ko So Yung) is a legal assistant and mother of two. She can't stand it when things are unfair. She also hates the people who look down on her because she is a working ahjumma (older woman). Plus, she's got a temper that would make sailors blush. Still, Shim Jae Bok puts up with all the condescension and false flattery around her. That is because Shim Jae Bok's life is not about her; it's about her family, and the future of her kids depends on her bowing her head and staying respectful. This means that Shim Jae Bok even puts up with the the fact that her husband Goo Jung Hee (Yoon Sang Hyun) is having an affair with the much younger Jung Na Mi (Im Se Mi from Shopping King Louis). Plus, her boss from hell Kang Bong Goo (Sung Joon from Hyde, Jekyll and I), tells her she is out of a job. Her life is in a tailspin, and then something miraculous happens. Shim Jae Bok receives an offer for an apartment from Lee Eun Hee (Jo Yeo Jung from Divorce Lawyers in Love), an offer that is way too good to be true. Suddenly, the miracle becomes a disaster. The eccentric ahjumma finds herself in the middle of a murder mystery. All the chaos in her life comes full circle, and Shim Jae Bok realizes that someone is destroying her life, piece by piece. Now, our ahjumma has to regain her true self--the kind who fights injustice and doesn't tolerate nonsense--in order to save what she has left. But when you have spent years pretending to be perfect, is it even possible to be yourself? Also known as Perfect Wife, Ms. Perfect is directed by Hong Seuk Ku (Golden"

Since he wasn't a graduate of Hwang Hee U., he was looked down upon by almost everyone at the hospital. Nam Hye Suk graduated with top marks and was regarded as a star student. She was an absolute fundamentalist and proud of herself. Dr. Choi Kang Gook became the new head of the Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery after being in exile for 5 years for getting into trouble with his former superior. He was a genius but he was also a stubborn surgeon who does not care for hospital politics. It ended up only LES and NHS were the only doctors who applied for residency and they were accepted with great reluctance after being rejected outright by Dr. CKG. Lee Dong Gwon, a famous actor, was admitted to the Hospital for arrhythmia surgery. He knew NHS from elementary school and was infatuated with her. Between him and LES, who would NHS choose?\n\n\u2014DramaWiki"

Ambitious, he moved into TV dramas which he helps with his star power and hinders with his terrible acting. He also has an exploitative, unethical manager. Yoon Gae Hwa is a housewife divorced from a rich husband who needs to earn enough money to keep her daughter in her custody while her ex-husband's new wife doesn't want the daughter of a previous wife around. Gae Hwa's sole prior work experience is 6 months as a reporter for a weekly scandal rag. Her first jobs shown in the series are unsuccessful but include 1 day as housekeeper for Sung Min Woo where a babysitting emergency forces her to leave early, infuriating Sung Min Woo. Shortly afterwards, she finds another job at a musical production company, learns a secret about Sung Min Woo, and convinces him to work on the agency's musical, and becomes Min Woo's handler for that agency as it prepares to put on a musical starring Min Woo (if he ever improves as an actor). Handling Min Woo is no easy task due to their mutual antagonism, spurred by Min Woo's immaturity. Min Woo grows up as he faces the challenges of caring for his unexpected 5-year-old daughter Ye Eun, the result of an affair several years earlier, and by Gae Hwa's example in caring for the otherwise unprotected Ye Eun. Min Woo gains maturity very quickly as he learns to accept and love his daughter and becomes something unexpected - a good actor. The romance also ends satisfyingly - but I'm not telling that part of the ending.\n\n\u2014dgdg"

Lee Ji Eun defies her parents' wishes to marry poor student Jang Sae Hoon, but unable to handle the burdens of poverty, she later succumbs to her family's pressure and divorces him. Heartbroken, her husband leaves for the U.S., and the two don't see each other again until Sae Hoon returns to Korea as a wealthy, self-made businessman, and runs into her again, now a lowly domestic helper. Ji Eun, having experienced many humbling turns in life since he left, is struggling to keep herself and her family afloat, and finds that their roles have been reversed-but will Sae Hoon ever be able to forgive her? Can the ashes of their love turn back into a flame?"

With strong ratings, Pink Lipstick'sstory of a good woman turned revenge-seeker against her cheating husband was picked up by a television network in Taiwan. It co-stars Park Kwang Hun (The Bean Chaff of My Life) and Lee Joo Hyun, who is probably best known as the charismatic detective inWhen It's at Night. Yoo Ga Eun (played by Park Eun Hye) is the kind of kind-hearted woman that everyone loves. After falling for Park Jung Woo (Lee Joo Hyun), she dates and then marries him. She has a perfect, happy life, especially after they adopt a daughter. One day, however, she discovers that her husband had an affair with her best friend Mi Ran (Seo Yoo Jung), and that her adopted daughter is the product of that liason. Shaken to the core, Ga Eun sets out on a course that proves that even nice women, when betrayed, can enact justice on those who hurt them. Leaving Jung Woo and taking her life in her own hands, she marries wealthy businessman Maeng Ho Geol as part of a carefully-constructed revenge plan. When a man named Ha Jae Bum (Park Kwang Hyun) unexpectedly enters her life, he may be just the one to offer her the love that her husband didn't - but can she learn to trust again? And when Jae Bum promises to support her no matter what, will she have to sacrifice him to gain revenge? Meanwhile, her ex-husband and scheming best friend discover that the woman they always took for granted has more to her than meets the eye..."

At first, people think she is a rich spoiled brat but there's more to her than meets the eye. She intervenes to salvage her 50-year-old second brother's marriage by getting rid of his mistress who had lied about getting pregnant by her brother. As the youngest child of a wealthy family, she has turned out alright instead of becoming a spoiled material girl. She is uber-confident and speaks her mind to everyone around her. One day, she falls head over heels for Hwang Mama, an irritable novelist and a perfectionist. Aurora oozes with charm and confidence. Nothing can faze her. Hwang Mama's chiseled good looks make him incomparable to other men. But he has one flaw that could torpedo his relationship with Aurora. Can the couple overcome it?\n\n\u2014MBC"

Being the eldest sibling, he wants to provide for his family instead of going to college. On the day of his 19th birthday, he gets into a car accident and passes out. He wakes up on the top of his school building. He thinks he survived and everything is normal. Except everyone thinks he died 12 years ago, and he hasn't aged at all. Jung Jung Won (Lee Yeon Hee, The Package) is Hae Sung's best friend. She was the one who took him to the place where he had his accident.

Cha Min Joon (Ahn Jae Hyun, Cinderella and Four Knights) is the owner of the restaurant where Jung Won works. He has feelings for her. However, she has never shown any interest in him. In her mind, she can't be with anyone while carrying Hae Sung in her memories. One night, Jung Won finds a young man passed out in front of her house. He is Hae Sung, her first love. She is now 31; he is 19. Can they pick up their love where they left off, or will their reunited worlds always stay separate? Also known as \"Into the World Again\" and \"Into the New World,\" Reunited Worlds is directed by Baek Soo Chan and written by Lee Hee Myung, the creative team behind Beautiful Gong Shim and Sensory Couple."

            "imdb_description": "Kang Min Joo (Kim Hee Ae) is a pragmatic, single, 40-something television producer who has no time for love and pretends she doesn't want any either. Deep down, though, she does wish something would happen in her love life. As fate would have it, she meets Go Sang Sik (Ji Jin Hee), an environmental facility section chief at city hall who sincerely believes he does not need any romance in his life. But when the two meet, love finds its way into their lives. Now, in a revival of the kind of romance they both left behind years ago, Kang Min Joo and Go Sang Sik will have to learn that no matter how much they try to deny it, the heart wants what the heart wants. Adding to the drama are Go Mi Ryeo (Oh My Ghostess star Kim Seul Gi), a webtoon writer and Sang Sik's little sister, and Min Ji Sun (Detectives of Seonam Girls' High School alum Stephanie Lee), a family friend's old flame who will form a love triangle with the two hesitant romantics. An official remake of the 2012 hit Japanese drama of the same name, Second to Last Love comes from director Choi Young Hoon, who has come a long way since his days as an assistant director on The Painter of the Wind. Screenwriter Choi Yoon Jung, whose daunting resume includes hits such as Mr. Baek, Emergency Couple and Lie to Me, pens the adaptation, once again channeling her nuanced understanding of what happens when you find romance where you least expect it. The first episode of Second to Last Love will air on SBS on July 30, 2016, with subsequent episodes airing every Saturday and Sunday at 10:00PM, in the time slot vacated by the conclusion of Beautiful Gong Shim. The drama is expected to run for 20 episodes, with an expected finale some time in September 2016. The full cast for Second to Last Love includes Ji Jin Hee as Go Sang Sik, Kim Hee Ae as Kang Min Joo, Kim Seul Gi as Go Mi Ryeo, Stephanie Lee as Min Ji Sun, Lee Soo Min as Go Ye Ji, and Kim Kwon as Cha Soo Hyuk."

Choi Oon Hyuk is a child prodigy born into a family of poor miners; Kim Hae Kyung is the eldest daughter of tenant farmers; Lee Dong-Woo is the heir to a wealthy, well-connected family; and Moon Suk Kyung is the only child of an affluent and powerful political ally of Japan. In a blend of personal choices and circumstances beyond their control, each individual embarks on different paths that reflect the chaotic nature of the time as well as their true character. As their paths collide, love, friendship, loyalty, vengeance, moral conscience, and ideology become driving forces to irrevocably change the course of their lives."

And again, a man she wanted to marry dumps her for the worst reason ever: that she's like bland, tasteless devil's-tongue jelly, which means she's not attractive at all as a woman. Just then, Joon Hee appears before her with a broad smile on his face. He's as refreshing as a soft drink. Joon Hee is Jin Ah's childhood best friend's younger brother, who used to live next door. Jin Ah has always remembered him as a little kid, but one day, he comes back as a really masculine man. When she is surprised by his change, her gut feeling tells her that she would truly fall in love this time."

Other characters include variety PDs, writers, and announcers who make up the broadcast station family. Jung plays a young woman named So-min who grew up in a remote mountain village. She finds herself working a number of odd jobs once she makes the big move to Seoul, determined to make her way in the world and work hard at a successful career. So-min (the character) is a little behind the fashions and tends to say weird things that puzzle people, but she's got a warm heart and a generous personality. Sadly, though, it's that trusting nature that also makes her a target for opportunists."

When bookish university professor Kim Chul Soo runs out of money and is forced to accept help from his ex-girlfriend, he will do anything to pay her back. Opportunity knocks in the form of a ghostwriting offer from the management agency of Lee Ma Ri, the most popular actress in Korea. Caught between his convictions and his need for money, Chul Soo reluctantly agrees. The travel diary he writes under Ma Ri's name becomes an instant bestseller, but it ends up bringing her some unwanted attention from a famous photographer. Afraid she'll be discovered for not writing the book, Ma Ri commissions Chul Soo to coach her in Japanese culture and travel as more suitors fall into place. Ma Ri and Chul Soo grow closer, and soon Ma Ri finds herself caught between four men."

Soo Ji is very possessive of Shi Hyun, who has asked her to marry him to spite their parents, who will be marrying each other soon. Seeing an opportunity for revenge against the man who snubbed her, Soo Ji makes a proposition to Shi Hyun who is an expert at seduction to the point that it's something of a hobby. If Shi Hyun can get Eun Tae Hee, the first love of a man who snubbed her and a notoriously cold-shouldered girl who thinks being swayed by love is pathetic, to fall in love with him so he can break her heart - she'll agree to marry him. Shi Hyun, wholly confident in his ability to play the game, accepts. But when these games of seduction and revenge turn into something real, everyone involved finds themselves drawn into something far more serious than they had ever anticipated."

Unlike other princesses, she is active and skilled in the arts and in sports. When the Baek Jae Empire crumbles due to a spy, Kum Hwa, she runs away with her bodyguard General Guishil Ari and falls in love with him in the meanwhile. The new conqueror Kim Yu Suk is also in love with the princess, but only receives hate in return. In a desperate attempt to win her, he kills Ari, but the princess runs away and jumps off a cliff to kill herself. While falling, she travels more than one thousand years into the future, which is our present time of 2003. Only she remains to be who she was, and she encounters Ari to be an aimless fashion designer Kang In Chul with a warm heart and bad temper. Although, he is annoyed at her ignorance of the present world, he comes to fall in love with the princess again. Fujiwara Tatsuji is the son of the Fujiwara dynasty, and once again is mysteriously attracted to the princess. Only she knows the past that holds all three of them together, but will things become an exact replica of the situation back then?"

She later discovers her pregnancy and demands that the hospital gets to the case's bottom. Eventually, she discovers that the donor whose child she is now pregnant with is none other than the CEO of a notable cosmetics firm named Diamond Cosmetics. This CEO, named Raphael, is going through a messy divorce with his wife Lee Ma Ri, a beautiful woman who does not want to split with her husband, chiefly for financial reasons. But when Raphael learns he is to be a father, things get very complicated - particularly after she realizes that there is a secret past connection that links him to Oh Woori."
